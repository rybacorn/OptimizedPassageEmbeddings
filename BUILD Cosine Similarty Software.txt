Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to a developer. Let’s do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.

Include a running count of the current question and total number of spec questions (e.g., Question 2 of 16) in every reply.

Here’s the idea:
I would like to create some cosine alaysis software to work for any client in the future. Output a complete prompt to help me build this software in a different chat. IT IS CRITICAL that every step of the way considers solid coding best practices. And every step of the way should be meticulously planned and updated to ensure this can be replicated for clients in the future. 

The output should include: 
HTML t

Here’s the idea: Passage Embedding Analysis for Content Optimization
✅ Objective
Build a system to compare original vs updated webpage content using embedding models to:

Measure semantic improvement relative to keyword intent

Visualize directional change toward target queries

Benchmark two competitors (Peacock vs Apple) on a shared topic (e.g., Wicked)

🎯 Project Goals
Extract structured on-page content (headings, descriptions, image alt text, etc.)

Generate sentence embeddings for both original and updated content

Track mean cosine similarity improvements toward query intent

Visualize changes in 3D to demonstrate semantic alignment with keywords

Support multi-client comparisons (e.g., Peacock vs Apple) with before/after tracking

🧩 Caveats & Requirements
Scripts must use Halo spinners for all major steps

Versioned file outputs are required (e.g., *-v2.html)

All embedding scripts must support manual file inputs for flexibility

Content is split by host filter (e.g., “peacock” vs “apple”) inside JSON

Updates are not global; each host’s before/after is analyzed independently

Query embeddings do not change; they act as a fixed intent anchor

🔄 Current Workflow Summary
HTML downloaded manually (wicked_peacock.html, etc.)

Content extracted using PeacockHTML_extraction.py

Extracts: titles, headings, img alt/src, <dt>/<dd>

Outputs: extracted_html_data-v*.json

Reformatted for analysis using reformat_for_scriptPeacock.py

Outputs: reformatted_input-v*.json + updated version

Visual comparison run using updated 3D comparison script

Loads original + updated

Separates Apple vs Peacock

Embeds all content + target queries

Computes mean embeddings and directional cosine improvements

Plots 3D map with arrows and query mean reference

Outputs: embedding_comparison-v*.html

🔮 Future Work
✅ Rank passages by distance from query mean

✅ Highlight most improved content

🔲 Add GSC query integration to weight keywords by impressions/clicks

🔲 Export similarity scores to CSV alongside HTML visual

🔲 Add support for grouping queries by intent theme (e.g., “cast” vs “trailer”)
